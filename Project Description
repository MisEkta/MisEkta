The stock market is known for being volatile, dynamic, and nonlinear. Accurate stock price prediction is extremely challenging because of multiple (macro and micro) factors, such as politics, global economic conditions, unexpected events, a company’s financial performance, and so on. 
But, all of this also means that there’s a lot of data to find patterns in. So, financial analysts, researchers, and data scientists keep exploring analytics techniques to detect stock market trends. This gave rise to the concept of algorithmic trading, which uses automated, pre-programmed trading strategies to execute orders.
This documentation presents a time series analysis project implemented in a Google Colab notebook. The project explores the analysis of a time series dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels. The dataset used in this project represents daily stock prices of a company and aims to demonstrate various aspects of time series analysis, including data visualization, stationarity testing, and forecasting.
